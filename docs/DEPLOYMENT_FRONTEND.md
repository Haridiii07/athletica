# Frontend Deployment Guide

## Quick Frontend Testing

The app has been optimized for frontend-only testing:

### Changes Made:
- ✅ **Disabled Firebase notifications** (commented out in main.dart)
- ✅ **Reduced splash screen delay** (2 seconds → 500ms)
- ✅ **Optimized for release mode** (faster compilation)

### Running Locally:
```bash
# Fast development mode
flutter run --release -d chrome

# Or use web server
flutter run --release -d web-server --web-port=3000
```

### Deploying to GitHub Pages:

1. **Run deployment script:**
   ```bash
   scripts/deploy-frontend.bat
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy frontend for backend integration"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main, folder: /docs
